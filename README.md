# DraftWise
## An AI-powered PRD Improver
DraftWise transforms a raw draft PRD into a well-structured, comprehensive final document by simulating professional team debates among domain-specific AI agents.

## What is DraftWise?

DraftWise is an AI-driven tool designed to enhance Product Requirement Documents (PRDs). It takes in a basic draft PRD as input, simulates a debate among multiple role-specific sub-agents (like UX leads, finance managers, DevOps engineers, and more), and outputs a polished, complete PRD.

These sub-agents are selected based on the content of the draft PRD and work collaboratively (and sometimes competitively!) to ensure all important aspects of product development are covered — from UX to deployment, from costs to compliance.

## How it Works

1. **Input Draft**: Users provide a raw PRD draft as input.
2. **Agent Debate**: Domain-specific AI agents are dynamically selected to critique and suggest improvements through a structured debate.
3. **Final Synthesis**: DraftWise synthesizes all feedback into a coherent, improved PRD.
